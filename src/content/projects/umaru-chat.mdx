**Umaru Chat** is a chat app that I made to push my skillset further. I never made a fullstack app before and barely know about backend stuff so what I ended up doing is using BaaS (Backend as a Service) which is Firebase. I also want to try to make a React app using Typescript. Honestly, I proud that I'm able to make this app but at the same time I'm not really proud of this app because it's my first time and obviously the code is a mess.

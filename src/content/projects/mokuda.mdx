## System Description

The **Air Quality Monitoring and Classification System** is designed to monitor real-time air conditions in the Malang City area using *Internet of Things* (IoT) technology and the *K-Nearest Neighbor* (KNN) classification method. The system utilizes an **ESP32** microcontroller connected to **MQ-131**, **MQ-135**, and **DSM501A** sensors to measure key air quality parameters such as Ozone (**O₃**), Nitrogen Dioxide (**NO₂**), Carbon Monoxide (**CO**), and Particulate Matter (**PM2.5**).

Sensor data is transmitted via the **MQTT** protocol to a backend service for storage in a database. The data is then processed into the daily Air Pollution Standard Index (**ISPU**) based on the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK) standards and classified using the **KNN** algorithm to generate air quality categories such as "Good", "Moderate", "Unhealthy", "Very Unhealthy", or "Hazardous". The results are displayed visually on a website, making them easy for the public to understand.

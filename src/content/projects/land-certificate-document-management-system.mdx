The current process of managing land certificate document data involves storing the data of land certificates issued by the National Land Agency (BPN) digitally in the Data and Information Center (Pusdatin) database. The physical land certificate documents are printed by PERURI and held by the respective individuals who own the land rights.

With the current process of managing land certificate document data, it operates under a centralized system, where the system heavily relies on a central point or main server. If this central point is hacked, all systems connected to it face risks, such as:

- Data breaches
- Data misuse

Additionally, the current process of managing land certificate document data is required to be transparent and traceable regarding the ownership information of the land certificates.

## Features

### 1. Notarization of Land Certificate Documents in a Blockchain System
Notarization of land certificate documents within a blockchain system, where the blockchain implementation utilizes IPFS cryptography and SHA256 hashing for the land certificate documents.

### 2. Verification of Land Certificate Documents in a Blockchain System
Verification of notarized land certificate documents within the blockchain system, aimed at ensuring transparency and traceability.

### 3. Transfer of Ownership of Notarized Land Certificate Documents in a Blockchain System
The process of transferring ownership of notarized land certificate documents by transferring the land certificate document from one user’s blockchain address to another user’s blockchain address.
